bubble-breaker
==============

My take at an assignment that I found on a web programming class.
The goal of the game is to clear out groups of bubbles until there is 
are only isolated bubbles left. The bigger the groups you picked, the higher
your score will be.
I did this one because I wanted to learn javscript and I found it to be 
a great way to learn the basics and to learn how to manipulate the DOM.
